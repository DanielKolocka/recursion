# recursion
This project from The Odin Project focuses on implementing JavaScript recursion to solve two classic computer science problems:

- Fibonacci Sequence Generator: Write both iterative and recursive functions to return an array containing the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

- Merge Sort Algorithm: Build a recursive function that sorts an array using the "divide and conquer" methodology of the Merge Sort algorithm.
